# API
##Description
*Cartoon Giphys* is a fun application in which a user can search various giphy's using the giphy.com API.  The page includes three buttons that query the API and load ten images of the predetermined giphy's.  There is a search bar available to the user to add their own search.  Once that is entered a new button will appear with the users selection, at which point the user can push the button and their giphys will appear.   The giphys appear in their non active state until the user clicks on one then it will play on repeat until clicked again to stop.
